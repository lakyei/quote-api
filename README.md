# Project - Quote API

## **Project Goals**

In this project, you’ll be building a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.

## **Setup Instructions**

You can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to open and work in **server.js** in a text editor. To edit **server.js**, use your text editor of choice. If you need a recommendation or help to install an editor, we recommend looking into this [article about setting up a text editor for web development](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code) (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice: Let’s Make a Project”). To run your API on your computer, you will need to install Node.js. If you need help installing Node.js, read our [article on installing Node](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally).

Once you have an editor an Node.js set up, download the project, unzip it, navigate to that folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to install Express before trying to start up your server.

## **Project Requirements**

1. You’ve been given some starter code in the form of a front-end site and some Express.js boilerplate. You’ll use this to build several route handlers to serve up interesting quotes. As you build out your app, test out the functionality either using our front-end or with a tool like [Postman](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-postman). Make sure to re-run `node server.js` as you make changes to the server, and visit `localhost:4001` in the browser to interact with the front-end.
    
    As you work, your server at any point with Ctrl + C in the terminal, and then restart it to see new changes in its behavior.
    
    In **server.js**, we’ve provided you with some imported helper functions and data:
    
    - A `quotes` array with some pre-populated quotes about technology. Each quote in the array has a `person` and `quote` property. You can use our array or write your own, but make sure to have at least the `person` and `quote` properties, as the front-end that we’ve provided expects each quote to have them.
    
    - The `getRandomElement()` function, which takes an array and returns a random element from that array.
    
 2. Set your server to listen on the `PORT` variable.
    
    Once you start up the server with `node server.js`, navigate to `localhost:4001` in the browser. You’ll know things are up and running when you load the blue Quote API site in the browser.
    
    This diagram [explains how the front-end buttons correspond to different request routes](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/quote-api/quote-frontend-diagram.png).
    
3. Your API should have a GET `/api/quotes/random` route. This route should send back a random quote from the `quotes` data. The response body should have the following shape:
```
    {
      quote: {/* quote object */}
    }
```

4. Your API should have a GET `/api/quotes` route. This route should return all quotes from the data if the request has no query params.
    
    If there is a query string with a `person` attribute, the route should return all quotes said by the same person. For instance, the data set has multiple quotes for Grace Hopper, so GET `/api/quotes?person=Grace Hopper` should return an array of only those quotes. If there are no quotes for the requested `person`, send back an empty array.
    
    The response body should have the following shape for all GET `/api/quotes` requests:
```    
    {
      quotes: [ /* Array of requested quotes */ ]
    }
```

5. Your API should have a POST `/api/quotes` route for adding new quotes to the data. New quotes will be passed in a query string with two properties: `quote` with the quote text itself, and `person` with the person who is credited with saying the quote.
    
    This route should verify that both properties exist in the request query string and send a `400` response if it does not. If all is well, this route handler should add the new quote object to the data array and send back a response with the following shape:
```    
    {
      quote: {/* new quote object */}
    }    
```
